# there are three Logical Keywords
# and keyword, if a = true and b = true, then result is also true. if even 1 is also false then result is also false
# or keyword, if atleast 1 of the variables is also true then result is also true
# not keyword will give you the opposite boolean result of the true result

#there are different methods 

# 1st method
print(1 < 2 and 2 < 3);

# 2nd method
print(1 < 2 < 3);

#using logical operator in order to compare 2 different data types
print('h' == 'h' and  2 == 2);

# using or keyword
print('h' == 2 or 3 == 3);

#using not keyword
print(not(1 == 1));

print(not(1 != 1));
