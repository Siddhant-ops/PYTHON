# What is A.I.

## Effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.

### Started in 1950 scientists started to think if computers can think ???

### At that time, AI was just predefined set of rules which gave an output like x and o or chess like rules no deeplearning and neural networks.

### At that time a very good AI was just very good set of rules ( IF ELSE ) statements.

### AI can be simple or complex. pacman, tictactoe. ALgorithms path finding algorithms.

# Now today

### AI has evolved a lot, machine learning, deep learning

### circle is AI

- Inside ML machine learning is
- Earlier talked about how AI is predefined set of rules
- Data in rules processing and giving output
- What is ml -- it figures out the rules for us instead of hardcoding take data input take result from input to train a model what rules are gonna be generated ?? not 100% accuracy every time
- goal of machine learning models : highest accuracy possible
- machine learning summary -- Rather than giving rules to the program it finds the rules for us

- inside neural networks -- it is form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data.

- input bubbles set of lines rules output bubble

- inpuut layer output layers rules connector

- multi stage inormation extraction process

- term 1 and term 2 and final first by hardcode then by ml model

All data is needed
and data is needed
wrong data model wrong

# Different types of ML

- ## Unsupervised Learning
- ## Supervised Learning
- ## Reinforcement Learning
